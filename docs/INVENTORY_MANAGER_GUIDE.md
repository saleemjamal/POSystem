| **Sent** | PO sent to distributor | ✅ Ready for GRN when goods arrive |
| **Partially Received** | Some goods received | ✅ Create more GRNs as goods arrive |
| **Closed - Complete** | All goods received | ✅ Nothing needed, well done! |

## 📝 Creating Goods Receipt Notes (GRNs)

### **What Information You Need:**
1. **PO Number** - From the delivery paperwork
2. **Invoice Number** - From distributor's invoice
3. **Amount** - Total value of goods received
4. **Date** - When goods were received (auto-fills to today)

### **Step-by-Step:**
1. **Open the form**: Menu → **📝 Record Goods Receipt**
2. **Select PO**: Only eligible POs will show in dropdown
3. **Fill details**: Invoice number and amount are required
4. **Add notes**: Optional, but helpful for tracking
5. **Submit**: GRN is created and will auto-approve in 60 minutes

### **Multiple Deliveries:**
- **Same PO, multiple deliveries?** Create separate GRNs for each
- **System tracks total**: Automatically calculates fulfillment percentage
- **No limit**: Create as many GRNs as needed per PO

**Q: What if I don't have the PO number?**

**Q: Can I edit a GRN after creating it?**
A: Contact system administrators (saleem@ or karima@) for corrections.

**Q: What if goods arrive damaged?**
A: Record the GRN for the amount actually usable, and add notes about damage.

**Q: How long do I have to record a GRN?**
A: Record as soon as possible, but there's no strict deadline. Even late GRNs are tracked.

**Q: What if no goods arrive for a PO?**
A: Don't create a GRN. The system will automatically close the PO after 10 days.
