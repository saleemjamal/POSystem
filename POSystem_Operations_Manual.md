## System Overview

The **POSystem** is Poppat Jamals' computerized system that manages all our purchasing and inventory across our 5 outlets:
- **Adyar** (ADY)
- **Mount Road** (MTR) 
- **Anna Nagar** (ANN)
- **Coimbatore** (COI)
- **Vijayawada** (VIJ)

### What Does It Do?

### Why Do We Use It?

- **Saves money** - Don't over-order slow-moving items
- **Saves time** - Automatic ordering and tracking
- **Professional communication** - Proper emails and documents to distributors
- **Better records** - Everything is tracked and documented

## Purchase Orders (POs)

### What is a Purchase Order?
A Purchase Order (PO) is our official request to a distributor to send us specific items. Think of it as a shopping list that we send to our suppliers.

### How POs Are Created
1. **System analyzes sales** from the last 180 days
2. **Calculates what to order** based on sales patterns
3. **Creates PO automatically** for each outlet and brand combination
4. **Waits for approval** from Purchase Manager

### PO Lifecycle (Journey of a PO)
```
Created → Approved → Sent → Goods Received → Closed
```

#### **Created**
- PO is generated by the system
- Contains recommended items and quantities
- Stored in archive file with calculated total amount

#### **Approved** 
- Purchase Manager reviews and approves
- Can modify quantities in the archive file
- Must refresh PO values after changes

#### **Sent**
- Email sent to distributor with PO details
- PDF attachment included
- Tracking updated to "Sent" status

#### **Goods Received**
- Items arrive at outlet
- Goods Receipt Note (GRN) created
- Status changes to "Partially Received" or "Closed - Complete"

#### **Closed**
- **Automatic closure after 10 days** if no action
- **Complete closure** when 100% of items received
- **Partial closure** when some items received but 10 days passed

### PO Auto-Closure Rules
- **When**: Every Monday at 9 AM
- **What**: POs older than 10 days are automatically closed
- **Status assigned**:
  - "Closed - Complete" if 100% received
  - "Closed - Partial" if some items received
  - "Closed - No Receipt" if nothing received

## Customer Orders (COs)

### What is a Customer Order?
A Customer Order (CO) is when a customer wants to buy something we don't have in stock. Instead of losing the sale, we order it directly from the distributor and have it sent to the customer.

### When to Create a CO
- **Customer wants item we don't have**
- **Customer needs large quantity** (more than we normally stock)
- **Special order** that customer will pay for

### How COs Work
1. **Customer requests item** → You create CO in system
2. **System calculates cost** → Uses average cost prices
3. **Auto-approval or manual approval** → Based on amount
4. **Email sent to distributor** → They ship direct to customer
5. **Customer receives goods** → You create GRN to record receipt

### CO Number Format
Customer Orders are numbered like this:
**CO-MTR-ALLTIM-250625-001**
- **CO** = Customer Order
- **MTR** = Mount Road outlet
- **ALLTIM** = Brand (All Time)
- **250625** = Date (25 June 2025)
- **001** = First CO of the day for this outlet/brand

## Goods Receipt Notes (GRNs)

### What is a GRN?
A Goods Receipt Note (GRN) is how we record that we received goods from a distributor. It's like a receipt that shows what came in and how much it cost.

### When to Create a GRN
- **Goods arrive at your outlet** from distributor
- **You have the distributor's invoice** with details
- **You've checked the goods** and confirmed quantities

### GRN Process
1. **Goods arrive** → Check against original order
2. **Create GRN** → Enter invoice details and amounts
3. **Wait 60 minutes** → System automatically approves
4. **OR approve manually** → If you have permission

### Auto-Approval Timing
- **GRNs are automatically approved after 60 minutes**
- **Happens every hour** on the hour
- **Saves time** - you don't need to manually approve every GRN

---

## Auto-Approval Rules

### Customer Order Auto-Approval
**Automatically Approved If:**
- Order value is **less than ₹10,000**
- AND contains **no new items** (items we've never sold before)

**Requires Manual Approval If:**
- Order value is **₹10,000 or more**
- OR contains **new items** (items not in our system)

**Backup Auto-Approval:**
- If not approved within 60 minutes, system will auto-approve anyway
- This prevents delays in customer service

### GRN Auto-Approval
**All GRNs are automatically approved after 60 minutes**
- Runs every hour
- Saves manual work
- Ensures receipts are processed quickly

### Purchase Order Auto-Closure
**POs are automatically closed after 10 days**
- Runs every Monday morning
- Prevents old POs from staying open forever
- Final status based on how much was received
